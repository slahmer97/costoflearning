The probability of each user being on ON state = P01 / (P01 + P10) = 0.5

Average users on ON state in the system = (N0+N1) * 0.5 = (16+16)0.5 = 8


Average Arrival Traffic in the system at each timeslot= 512000*0.001*16 = 8192

Available bandwidth per resource block at each time slot= 513000 * 0.001 = 513

Available bandwidth in the system at each timeslot = 15 * 513000 * 0.001 = 7695
